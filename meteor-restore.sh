# The meteor.com Hot Dump 2-step
# Restore a mongo db from a local dump dir to an app hosted on meteor.com
#
# Splits up the output of:
#    meteor mongo $METEOR_DOMAIN --url
# and pushes it into
#    mongorestore -u $MONGO_USER -h $MONGO_DOMAIN -d $MONGO_DB -p "${MONGO_PASSWORD}"
#
# Doing so by hand is tedious as the password in the url is only valid for 60 seconds.
#
# As per the monogorestore docs:
#
# - mongorestore recreates indexes recorded by mongodump.
# - all operations are inserts, not updates.
# - mongorestore does not wait for a response from a mongod to ensure that the MongoDB process has received or recorded the operation.
# - The mongod will record any errors to its log that occur during a restore operation, but mongorestore will not receive errors.
#
# Requires
# - meteor  (tested on 0.8.1)
# - mongodb (tested in 2.4.0)
#
# Usage
#    ./meteor-restore.sh goto
